# saints-map
Mapping where christian saints come from. More saints -> holier the country! *joke*

This project came as a joke answer to a convrsation between friends about a claim of a Greek prime-minister that the country was doing quite well, since among other things it has whole two saints canonised during the previous 10 years. 

It seemed like a fun start project to try Wiki scrapping, since it wher I was going to get the list of saints from.
